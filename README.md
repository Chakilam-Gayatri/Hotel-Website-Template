# Little Palm Island Resort Replica

Welcome to the repository for the Little Palm Island Resort Replica project!

This is the biggest and the best  front-end project I've ever worked on. Unfortunately the videos couldn't be uploaded due to size issues. 
I really put my heart and soul ino this. The template of the website is a recreation of the "Little Palm Island" resort website, ofcourse with my personal touch.
