# Hotel Website Template

This is the biggest and the best  front-end project I've ever worked on. Unfortunately the videos couldn't be uploaded due to size issues. 
I really put my heart and soul ino this. The template of the website is a recreation of the "Little Palm Island" resort website, ofcourse with my personal touch.

PS :The website front-end contains 4 webpages that you can navigate to, so don't forget to have a look at all of them :)
